Step 7: Ergonomics: Users have a chance to take care of their physical and mental health as they would be able to get ergonomic images on how to take care of their posture.
**5. Instructions on how to run the tests:**

Preconditions:** 
1\.** User needs to clone the repository.

2\. Users need to follow installation procedures on the main page for running PHP Server.

3\. Users need to sign up on the application.

Post following the preconditions, the user can head to the test case folder. Three test cases are provided to the user for use. Users can run the home.html file and follow the instructions in the test case folder to run the test cases. 


**6. Example Use Case:** 


The user should be able to sign up in the application on the home page and post sign up, user will have access to login using his credentials. Users can log in into the application. Once the user is logged into the application, he will be redirected to the home page. On the home page, there will be a top navigation bar. There are options such as reminders, breaks, and ergonomics. Users can select the breaks and ergonomics tab, which will redirect the user to the breaks and ergonomics page. On the breaks and ergonomics page, the user can set a timer for which he will receive a pop-up to take a break and suggest some ergonomic activities. 

**6.1 Instructions:** 

\1) Place the project folder into /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs

\2) Clone the repository into the local folder using the command: git clone <https://github\.com/pranavganeshvt/WorkWell>
\3) After cloning the repository, use the local cloned folder and open it in the editor of your choice (VSCode, etc)\. 
\4) Open the home\.html file and run it after following the instructions for the installation listed above\. 
\5) After this, there will be a page loaded on localhost that will ask for login and signup\. 
\6) Click on the Signup button, enter user details, and register\. The user will be redirected to the home page\. Users can now sign in using these credentials\. 
\7) After signing in, the user will be able to see a navigation bar on the top\. The user needs to select breaks and ergonomics\. 
\8) Text field will appear, asking the user how many minutes he is willing to take a break periodically\. Users can enter the value in minutes (30, 60, etc) 

\9) Timer will run for the set time, and after post-timer expiry, the user will get a pop-up to take a break and will be given a few ergonomic exercises to try\. 

**6.2 Expected Outcome:** 

\1) User will enter the time after which he wants to take a break\. 
\2) Timer needs to run for the duration set\. 
\3) After the timer expires, the user should get prompts to take a break and perform ergonomic exercises\.
